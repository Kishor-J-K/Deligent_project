# Mini E-commerce Data Project

This project provides three small Python programs that together produce a synthetic e-commerce dataset, load it into a local SQLite database, and produce a joined report.

Project overview

- data/: holds generated CSV files and the exported query report.
- src/: Python programs:
    - `generate_data.py` — creates realistic synthetic CSVs for customers, products, orders, order_items, and payments. The script uses Faker and deterministic seeding so runs are reproducible. It writes the following CSVs into `data/`:
        - `customers.csv` (customer_id, name, email, phone, signup_date)
        - `products.csv` (product_id, product_name, category, price)
        - `orders.csv` (order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount)
        - `order_items.csv` (order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, subtotal)
        - `payments.csv` (payment_id, order_id, payment_method, payment_status, payment_date)

    - `load_to_sqlite.py` — creates (or opens) a SQLite database file named `ecom.db`, defines tables that mirror the CSV schemas, and loads the CSV contents into those tables using `pandas` and `sqlite3`. After loading, it validates that the row counts in the database match the CSV inputs.

    - `run_query.py` — reads the SQL in `query.sql`, executes it against `ecom.db`, prints a preview of the results, and writes the full output to `data/query_report.csv`.

- `query.sql`: contains a multi-table JOIN that combines customers, orders, order_items, products, and payments to produce a per-order-item report with these fields: customer name, product name, quantity, order date, payment method, payment status, and order total.

How the programs work (behavioral description)

- generate_data.py
    - Builds a small catalog of products and a pool of customers.
    - Simulates a sequence of orders. Each order contains 1–4 order items chosen from the product catalog; item quantities and per-item subtotals are computed from product price × quantity.
    - Adds simple shipping and occasional discounts, then writes each dataset to separate CSV files in `data/`.

- load_to_sqlite.py
    - Creates tables with appropriate primary keys and foreign key relationships.
    - Uses `pandas.DataFrame.to_sql()` to write CSV contents into SQLite tables (replacing any existing table of the same name).
    - Reads back counts from the database to ensure the number of rows inserted equals the CSV row counts.

- run_query.py
    - Loads `query.sql`, executes it against `ecom.db` using pandas' SQL reader, and prints a preview of results.
    - Exports the full query result to `data/query_report.csv` for downstream analysis or reporting.

Outputs

- CSVs in `data/` (generated by `generate_data.py`): customers.csv, products.csv, orders.csv, order_items.csv, payments.csv.
- SQLite database file `ecom.db` (created by `load_to_sqlite.py`).
- Exported report `data/query_report.csv` (created by `run_query.py`).

Notes and recommendations

- The generator uses deterministic seeding to make the synthetic data reproducible. You can change counts and parameters inside `src/generate_data.py`.
- `ecom.db` is omitted from version control by default; generated CSVs currently are committed in this project. If you prefer to keep generated outputs local only, add the appropriate `data/*.csv` patterns to `.gitignore`.
- The provided `query.sql` is a simple example. You can modify it to produce aggregated reports, date filters, or customer-level summaries.

If you want the exact terminal commands to run these scripts, mention that and the README can be extended with a short "how to run" section containing platform-appropriate instructions.
